        <div className="faq-data-question">What is Mobike’s Vision</div>
        <div className="faq-data-answer">
          <p>Transportation is one of the most basic human needs that is required for everyday living. We discovered that within this need, especially in cities, is the demand for short distance travel. Currently, there are not many good solutions to tackle this problem, so Mobike is born to fulfil this demand - to help people complete short trips through a more affordable and convenient way.</p>
          <p>To achieve this goal, we chose the most universal and simple transportation tool - the bike. With an idea and the innovative R&D, we designed and created the bike frame and the smart lock to make short distance travel easy and convenient.</p>
          <p>Mobike also helps to make sure everyone’s travel greener and environmentally friendly as well as to reduce traffic congestions that would lead to a better quality of life for everyone.</p>
          <p>We would like to work with other large brands who share the same values, to mutually benefit from this ecological & innovative way of transportation. You can learn more about us at www.mobike.com/sg or our social networks.</p>

        <div className="faq-data-question">What are the features?</div>
        <div className="faq-data-answer">
          <p>Apart from locking & unlocking the bike and automatic payment, Mobike has many features: click on the menu icon to enter “your account” / user center.</p>
          <p>In your account, you can access to the total distance you rode, the details of all your trips, your Mobike credit and your personal invitation code. When you click on any trip in “My Trip” option, you will get a summary of the trip along with the trip route.</p>
          <p>App versions 3.1 and above include the Mobike Credit feature. The better way you use Mobike, the higher credit you will accumulate. <b>Good behaviour includes parking the bike at preferred Mobike stations, reporting wrongfully parked bikes or defective bikes, detailing where you parked the bike for the next user to find it more easily, etc.</b> On the other hand, the poor behaviour will cause reduction on your Mobike credit, and the potential risk for account-freeze if your credit gets down to 0. To check on your credit details, go to User Center -> My Mobike Credit.</p>

          <p>When you successfully reserve a bike, it will be the only one to appear on the map, along with directions to get to it. When you get close to it, you can ring it to find it more easily.</p>
          <p>The bike’s location system might be influenced by the surroundings, therefore its actual location might vary a little bit from the APP, so please keep an eye out around the location on the APP to find the bike.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>If the APP prompts you with “Please make sure you are next to the bike and try again”, you can try to wiggle the lock and the back wheel. The bike will beep three times, please wait a minute and try to scan the code again.</li>
            <li>If the APP prompts you with “I’m having a rest, please try another bike”, this bike might be temporarily unusable, waiting for our operation team to intervene</li>
            <li>If the bike’s lock has a blue blinking light, it means another user reserved it</li>
            <li>If you tried all the above and still can’t unlock the bike, this bike might be temporarily unusable, waiting for our operation team to intervene. You can help us by clicking on the icon in the bottom right corner and reporting this bike’s problem.</li>
